# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

To be, or not to be, that is the question‚Äî  
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer  
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,  
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,  
And by opposing end them?  
‚Äî William Shakespeare, *Hamlet*

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sudoku Puzzle Solver repository. This repository contains a script, `script.py`, which is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles. 
Note that the name of the binary has been changed from "sudoku" to "sudoku_puzzle."
This is because I made another file called sudoku.py that has the engine that solves any given sudoku board

## Running the Script

To execute the script, simply run:

```bash
python script.py
```

## Output Message
At the end of running script.py, there is a special message that will be displayed. Make sure to run the script to see what it says!

## Challenges and Experience
My experience in solving this Sudoku puzzle has been quite sour. 
The intricacies of the puzzle having to read the outputs, coupled with unexpected format requirements, made the process frustrating and tedious. Specifically, the challenge format used "flag:" instead of the default "flag{", which forced me to print all the lines to check for the correct format. This, unfortunately, resulted in my terminal being flooded with output and becoming nearly unusable.
